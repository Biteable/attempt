== Description
   A thin wrapper for begin + rescue + sleep + retry.

== Prerequisites
   Ruby 1.8.0 or later.
   
== Installation
   rake test (optional)
   rake install (non-gem) or rake install_gem (gem)
   
== Synopsis
   require 'attempt'
   
   # Attempt to ftp to some host, trying 3 times with 30 seconds between
   # attempts before finally raising an error.
   #
   attempt(3, 30){
      Net::FTP.open(host, user, passwd){ ... }
   }
   
   # Or, do things the long way...
   code = Attempt.new{ |a|
      a.tries    = 3
      a.interval = 30
   }
   
   code.attempt{
      Net::FTP.open(host, user, passwd){ ... }
   }

== Future Plans
   Add the ability to set an absolute maximum number of seconds to prevent
   nested sleep/retry from delaying attempts longer than expected.

== Known Bugs
   None that I'm aware of. If you find any bugs, please log them on the
   project page at http://www.rubyforge.org/projects/shards.

== Notes From the Author
   Use with caution. Specifically, make sure you aren't inadvertantly
   wrapping code that already performs sleep + retry. Otherwise, you'll
   end up with a series of nested retry's that could take much longer to
   work than you expect.
